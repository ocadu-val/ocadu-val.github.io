![](logo.svg | width=100)

Compara stems from a research project that visualizes a taxonomy of software packages and the relationships they have to users, tasks, interaction elements, file formats, and the various computer languages part of their respective architectures.

The taxonomy and interactive index are a component of the [iCity](https://uttri.utoronto.ca/research/projects/icity/) project which brings together academic, government, and industrial partners in order to improve the quality of life for urban residents and visitors through the development and integration of advanced IT infrastructure for the purpose of managing transit and transportation. The taxonomy and resulting tools shown have expanded to include resources for urban planning which also impact transit and transportation.
