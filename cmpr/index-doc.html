					<p>The OCAD University <a alt="Open Visual Analytics Lab in new window" href="http://www2.ocadu.ca/research/val" target="_blank">Visual Analytics Laboratory</a> (VAL) has developed a taxonomy of end users, software systems, data types, tasks and interactivity within the domain of smart city transportation planning. This paper contributes to a taxonomy by creating Compara, an intuitive, interactive and searchable index that visualizes the attributes of software from a wide-range of applications and technologies. The taxonomy began as a spreadsheet that we transformed into a custom interactive data visualization that could help users find and understand existing tools and their attributes<sup><a href="#endnotes0">1</a></sup>.</p>

					<p>The taxonomy and interactive index are a component of the <a alt="Open iCity Project site in a new window" href="http://uttri.utoronto.ca/research/projects/icity/" target="_blank">iCity</a> project which brings together academic, government, and industrial partners in order to improve the quality of life for urban residents and visitors through the development and integration of advanced IT infrastructure for the purpose of managing transit and transportation. The taxonomy and resulting tools discussed in this paper have expanded to include resources for urban planning which also impact transit and transportation.</p>

					<p>One of the primary uses of the taxonomy is to help various iCity project teams and stakeholders locate software that may be useful to their design and development process, as well as to understand the end-users of this technology. The taxonomy may be used to develop a city management dashboard for city planners and analysts, or equally, to design a city-services facing mobile service application.</p>

					<main class="entry-content">
						<p>The data visualization problem we address is how to convert a large and growing spreadsheet of categorized, hierarchical, and relational qualitative data into an interactive visual diagram that can be used to quickly understand the broad-scale application landscape of transit and transportation digital tools. We look for hierarchical patterns and represent the associations that the taxonomy indicates of sub-attributes. Put another way, how can we visualize a software taxonomy and the relationships that it captures? It includes sub-attributes such as user-types, technologies, data types and format, tasks, visualization types, and levels of interactivity.</p>

						<p>The aim of the taxonomy is to help end-users sort through the software landscape to understanding the qualities of domain tools and then choose products or design software to meet the needs of the domain. To be successful, Compara must deploy a consistent glossary of terms, so that attribute terms appear for multiple software products. Compara must also allow users to identify software associated with specific user-types. Since user-type is one attribute amongst many, Compara must generalize the identification algorithm for other attributes.</p>

						<p>The scope and limitations of this data visualization problem is impacted by the reality that the software taxonomy can never said to be fully complete as new software are always being released, and identifying every last one in the market is difficult. This is a data collection problem not a visualization problem. Ideally, the visualization that we develop should be able to generalize to other instantiations of this kind of problem, namely visualizing an entire hierarchical index and its associated attributes. New data can constantly be added. <button class="fig" onclick="location.href='#description0/figure1'">Figure 1</button> illustrates the overall structure of the taxonomy spreadsheet in its original instantiation.</p>

						<p>We focused on the general themes of hierarchical structures, node-link representation, and examples of visual taxonomy from software research. A taxonomy is essentially a system of classification that typically organizes categories by their sub-ordinate or super-ordinate relationships within a hierarchy <a href="#bibliography0">(Cain, 2011)</a>. Taxonomic classification systems exist within many domains of research including software engineering, database work, genealogical recording, bibliometrics, and others, but the idea is most typically associated with the classification of organisms in the biological sciences.</p>
						<p>Taxonomies and hierarchies are often visualized using tree diagrams, a visualization technique that dates back centuries and whose early works are often attempts to depict the ancient classification systems developed by philosophers such as Aristotle.</p>
						<p>In <i><a href="#bibliography0">The Book of Trees: Visualizing Branches of Knowledge</a></i> by Lima (2014), various kinds of tree diagrams and their historical origins are depicted. Tree diagrams are not limited to the typical visual structure that actually looks like a figurative tree, and the concept of visualizing hierarchical structures has taken on more and more abstracted forms over time, each with their unique advantages. </p>

						<p>The above examples provide options for visualizing hierarchical structures, but our visualization problem also involves revealing attributes associated with individual software, which in the current project context are found as the most subordinate leaf nodes. Visualizations showing software and associated attributes can be found in software engineering research. One such example comes from <a href="#bibliography0">Grimstead et al (2005)</a> where they create a list of categorized software systems and score them based on their scalability.</p>
						<p>As can be seen in the table they present, these software systems are each associated with the presence or absence of some attributes. To summarize the data, the researchers made numerous attribute values and averaged them, and then visualized the scores along the axes of a polar plot to create shapes for each software group. Note that leaf-level taxonomical information is lost in the averaged the polar plot.<br /> <br />

						Another example of taxonomy in the area of software development comes from <a href="#bibliography0">Kucher and Kerren (2015)</a> where they visualized a taxonomic classification system for text- based visualizations. </p>

						<p>Their taxonomy is an attempt to understand the inventory of text-based visualization that is a result of social media creating an explosion of data to mine.

						<p>For our taxonomy and attribute visualization to be comprehensive, we must be able to show connections at the leaf-level that reveal individual software to be compared. Types of node-link visualizations showing leaf-level connections include arc-diagrams and bi-partite diagrams. Arc-diagrams draw link connections between nodes that exist along a single axis (<a href="#bibliography0">Wattenberg, 2002</a>) while bi-partite diagrams show linked associations between two sets of nodes representing distinct classes (<a href="#bibliography0">Wang et al, 2015</a>). </p>

						<p>An example of an arc-diagram depicting relations between software task types is shown in a visualization created by Autodesk in 2010 depicting which application tasks are most used in their 3D modelling software 3DsMax. In contrast, a bipartite graph from a neuroscience article shows which of two sets of brain regions are connected (<a href="#bibliography0">Bohland et al, 2009</a>).<br /> <br />

						While not comprehensive, the above brief literature review offers a view of the landscape for hierarchical and software taxonomic visualization. </p>

						<p>Interestingly, we did not find an identical example of software taxonomy visualization that solves the exact same problem as our current project mandate. While the taxonomic systems visualized in the literature showed categorization schemes for software, we have an entire database of software that must be organized into a hierarchy and sorted based on external attribute values. In the next section, we outline the design process and results of our prototyping efforts.</p>

					<main class="entry-content">
						<p>To solve the visualization problem we undertook design sketching and rapid- prototyping. For our visualization to be useful, we aimed to visualize as much of the spreadsheet information as possible without making the visualization confusing or difficult to understand. We started our design process focused mostly on the hierarchical structure of the software taxonomy and later integrated attribute visualizations. Below images that demonstrate our design sketching and thinking process. Some are hand-sketched and others created with digital tools. A description of each of the sketches is provided below each figure.</p>

						<p>We created a tree diagram as a starting point – <button class="fig" onclick="location.href='#design0/figure3'">Figure 3</button>. The root node represents the entire dataset, which branches out into software categories. The final sub-ordinate level, the leaf level, consists of each software system. This diagram is an example of a multidirectional tree diagram and was manually constructed using Simplemind, a mind-mapping application. This first step was promising as it represents our first digital representation. This visualization however was hand-made and not generated by inputting data and running an algorithm, and therefore was not a suitable finished solution for this project.</p>

						<p>We experimented with a series of different ideas. We first planned to connect the leaves of the tree diagram to show relationships between software through arcs. We then created a sunburst-like visualization, with a chord diagram in the center to show relationships. We later tried force-diagrams, a type of multidirectional tree diagram using web-based spatial auto- organization based on weighted relationships. Finally, we attempted treemaps with inner- connections between leaves, and the same using circular treemaps. In all cases, we tried to represent a hierarchy, and then introducing new lines or visual variables. None of these represent a comprehensive solution, but this was an important brainstorming session when considering various options.</p>

						<p>We then revisited the original tree diagram but added external nodes as illustrated in <button class="fig" onclick="location.href='#design0/figure4a'">Figure 4a</button>. <button class="fig" onclick="location.href='#design0/figure3'">Figure 3</button> can be seen in the center of the diagram, while the clusters are the periphery represent the external attributes. Connections from the taxonomy leaves to the attribute nodes visualizes which software is associated with which of the attributes.</p>

						<p>This visualization is a precursor to our final project solution, but reveals some important lessons and limitations. What this indicates is that while this complex node-link setup does in fact show all the information simultaneously, it remains rather confusing and difficult to understand. Tracing the connections from attributes to software taxonomy is difficult to follow, and the image is too busy to easily follow and see the intricate relationships. This visualization was also made manually using Simplemind.</p>

						<p>We experimented with the idea of connecting multiple tree diagrams in an ordered fashion, as in <button class="fig" onclick="location.href='#design0/figure4b'">Figure 4b</button>, but it became clear that this was interesting but unnecessary, and that the concept of a bipartite graph (mentioned in the literature review) would be sufficient for matching software with attributes. At this level of design thinking we became confident that our visualization concept of combining tree diagram with a bipartite graph could actually work to represent both the taxonomy and the associated attributes. From here we felt comfortable to begin prototyping using more committed and advanced methods, as will be shown below.</p>

Five interactive elements include link highlights (<button class="fig" onclick="location.href='#result0/figure7'">Figure 7</button>), node highlights (<button class="fig" onclick="location.href='#result0/figure8'">Figure 8</button>), node selection (<button class="fig" onclick="location.href='#result0/figure9'">Figure 9</button>), attribute switch (<button class="fig" onclick="location.href='#result0/figure10'">Figure 10</button>) and zoom.</p>

						<p>To increase the legibility of our graph, users can zoom close up to the visualization to read text or focus on specific visual regions. The zoom centers on the current mouse location.<br /><br />

							<b>Implementation</b>.<br /><br />
							The implementation of our tree-diagram/bipartite graph is described below. To implement the design for the tree-diagram/bipartite graph, we decided to use the web-browser visualization technology D3. We chose D3 as there are many visualization techniques previously implemented in D3. </p>

							<p>D3 provides a robust Javascript library with rich development resources and extensive community support and it is open source. It effectively supports interactivity. It is easy to integrate D3 into any web application framework. There will thus be less required effort in producing a web-based dashboard application that could be useful for presenting to OCAD U researchers or stakeholders.</p>

							<p>We planned to write a script that would produce the visualization in a web-browser. The script parses and models the data read from a JSON file and renders a hybrid visualization. The data processing is shown in the <button class="fig" onclick="location.href='#result0/figure11'">Figure 11</button> System diagram.</p>

							<p>Since D3 works best with standard file formats such as CSV and JSON, we manually extracted and formatted the data from the raw spreadsheet file to a CSV file. Then we converted the CSV file to a JSON file using an external web service with a custom template.<br /><br />
								We explain the algorithm to build the tree and bi-partite diagram in terms of node and link construction. For the nodes and links of the tree diagram, D3 has built-in support for generating a tree layout object from a provided JSON data file. The D3 code for creating collapsible tree diagrams can be found at <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4339083" target="_blank">https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4339083</a>. For the styling of the leaf nodes, nodes with connections or links (as part of the bi-partite diagram) are in blue and those without connections are in grey.</p>

							<p>For the bi-partite diagram, since the raw data itself does not contain explicit relationships, we had to do some text mining to extract and construct relationships between software leaves and its attributes. There are currently two attributes used (i.e., “user type” and “user task”) from the larger dataset spreadsheet which contains others. For example, given an attribute called “User Type”, we construct a list of nodes of distinct user types from the raw data. We draw a link between a software node and a user type node if the software supports that user type. We also sort the list of attribute nodes by their number of connections from most to least in order to reduce overlap between links, thereby making the visualization more legible. It should be noted that the bipartite aspect of our visualization was coded in d3 custom by the authors of this project.</p>

							<p>In terms of interactivity, we implemented pan/zoom and node/link highlighting and selection. Since the visualization is scaled to fit the browser window, nodes and texts are scaled down and may not be legible. With panning and zooming, users are able to freely adjust the area of focus in the visualization. The compound visualization consists of multiple levels and numerous nodes and edges, which may take higher cognitive loads to trace the origin of one or more links. We implemented node and link highlighting to ease that problem. Currently, users can highlight a single link between a software node and an attribute node by hovering the mouse cursor over the link. Alternatively, they can hover on either side of the nodes to highlight a node label and its links if there is any. They are able to persist the highlighting by mouse clicking, but only one node or link can be highlighted at a time.</p>

						<p>While our visualization results succeeded in fulfilling the initial criteria for this project, our visualization could be improved and developed further.</p>
						<p>A list of suggested immediate improvements that can be made:</p>

						<p>1. Nodes in the hierarchy should be collapsible, so that users can observe connections made between the hierarchy and attributes at different levels of the hierarchy. This would allow the comparison of aggregated data rather than only individual software platform data points. To optimize the visual space and reduce clutter, the link nodes could be made into curved lines rather than straight lines.<br /><br />
						2. The node links could be optimized to further reduce edge crossings, thus reducing visual clutter. This process would be algorithmic, and automatically optimize for every new set of attributes or changes to the visualization.</p>
						<p>3. Highlighting parent nodes in the tree diagram should highlight its ancestor nodes and links as well as its children nodes and links in the tree diagram and the bi-partite graph. This would offer a more comprehensive exploration by the user.</p>

			      <p><b>Integrating the Visualization into a Comprehensive Dashboard Application</b><br /><br />
							Here we propose a design for taking our visualization a step further and integrating it into a web-based dashboard application that offers information over and beyond what is already available through the tree-diagram bi-partite graph. We have named this proposed design as Project Compara. <button class="fig" onclick="location.href='#future0/figure12'">Figure 12</button> shows a visual mockup of the dashboard application layout.</p>
						<p>The dashboard design is created with four functional sections for analyzing the data of the toolsets. The main section is designed to have the main visualization type as a tree, with the root titled as the dashboard title itself: Compara. It expands out into the first level of headings, which expands out into another group of subheadings of the software tools. Changing this tree structure would be based on the JSON data file that is loaded into the dashboard. The next section consists of a force-directed layout that provides the user the ability to seek direct relationships between software packages.</p>

						<p>The third section acts as a middle ground, providing general information about the selected tool, including title, product description, the highlighting of the user types and tasks associated. </p>
						<p>The last section is a treemap visualization that places focus on hierarchy, from main category of software down to the software itself. Additional items considered for the treemap include a list of keywords that contribute to the rationale and description of the categories.</p>

						<p>This places emphasis on hierarchy allowing the user to have a clear understanding of how software selected in the tree relates to the subject matter of focus, intended by the manufacturer of the tool. Based on our research of visualization methods, the force-directed layout (bottom-left) as well as treemap reflect the ability to place focus on relationships and hierarchy, respectively. Extra D3 visualization methods can be daisy chained from the original data set, and further qualitative information can be embedded to offer extra information regarding software platforms or other features (bottom-middle).</p>

						<p>To conclude we will review the initial criteria of this project including the project purpose and the objectives and questions to evaluate the success of our visualization. Finally, we will discuss potential future improvements as well as possible applications for our visualization project.<br /><br />

						We believe our visualization is a viable solution to the stated purpose of this project. We visualized the entire software taxonomy, making clear its hierarchical structure in a way that is organized and understandable using a horizontal tree-diagram.<br /><br />

						We implemented a bipartite graph to successfully visualize how attributes are connected to software platforms, even when some software or platforms have multiple relationships. We achieved one of the central uses for this visualization project, which was to help users identify which software are associated with specific user-types. </p>

						<p>We also created a way to discover relationships between different sets of attributes and software platforms using the drop-down menu. We believe this visualization technique can be generalized to other domains. This visualization can definitely be scaled to datasets of different sizes to show different hierarchical structures and associations, but comparing qualitative attributes becomes difficult when the structure becomes too large.<br /><br />

						Based on our initial objectives and questions, we believe our visualization has appropriate answers for each. In order to visualize a hierarchical structure and associated external attributes, we implemented a tree-diagram/bipartite graph. </p>

						<p>From our own research, we cannot find an example of this kind of visualization being used in any similar context. It is possible that we have created an innovative visualization approach. We converted a structured spreadsheet into a visualization that makes the hierarchical structure much clearer than a traditional tabular format. We believe that our visualization has translated an indexical structure into something that is both aesthetic and engaging, incorporating smooth D3 vector visuals with exploratory interactive features. Finally, we believe this visualization is most effective when it supports user interactions, which allow users to solve the perceptual problems that arise when dealing with an intricate and dense visual structure as this one. <button>&nbsp;</button></p>
